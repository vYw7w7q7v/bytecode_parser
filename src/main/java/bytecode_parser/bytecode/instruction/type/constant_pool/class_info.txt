4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure
The CONSTANT_Class_info structure is used to represent a class or an interface:

CONSTANT_Class_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 name_index;
}
The items of the CONSTANT_Class_info structure are the following:

tag
The tag item has the value CONSTANT_Class (7).

name_index
The value of the name_index item must be a valid index into the constant_pool table. The constant_pool entry at that index must be a CONSTANT_Utf8_info (ยง4.4.7) structure representing a valid binary class or interface name encoded in internal form (ยง4.2.1).

Because arrays are objects, the opcodes anewarray and multianewarray can reference array "classes" via CONSTANT_Class_info structures in the constant_pool table. For such array classes, the name of the class is the descriptor of the array type.

For example, the class name representing a two-dimensional int array type

int[][]
is

[[I
The class name representing the type array of class Thread

Thread[]
is

[Ljava/lang/Thread;
An array type descriptor is valid only if it represents 255 or fewer dimensions.
